# LibPaxos

This is a fork from LibPaxos, to be used in the project KVPaxos. Here the message sent to the proposer is a fixed struct, so it can be easily reconstructed and the client IP can be attached, in order to answer the request.

You can find the original LibPaxos [here](https://bitbucket.org/sciascid/libpaxos/src/master/).
You can find the KVPaxos project [here](https://github.com/gabrieltron/libpaxos).
